# Status
The assignments are submitted.
We have one team to evaluate our design.

# Reflection on team roles
I had a meeting about the priorities with Sebastian because we were recommended to coordinate the work of plants and monitors.
It seemed to go well, at the end we had a simple "roadmap" graph about how the issues depend on each other, which I explained the next day to the team.
I also wanted the team to split up and the implementers do the issues, the others work on design. The implementers finished. The design is still unfinished. I hope there's a better and less aggressive/artificial way of getting things done.

# Tips
Also, multiple team members said in the tips/tops that they did not express their true opinion during the meeting.
