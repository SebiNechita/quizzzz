# Status
We had multiple meetings last week and made
* a draft report
* improved design
* Q&A question
* endpoints
* upload meeting documents
* HTTPS connectivity

This means we finished every task we had assigned.

# Reflection on team roles
Sander and I determined two tasks we can already start with in Spring/JFX (monitor-plant discussion)

# Comments
I forgot to ask the evaluator team to provide measurable properties along with their list of HCI issues, which was a point in the HCI assignment.
