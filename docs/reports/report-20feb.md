We finished the design.

Sebastian and Kaushik had created many slides already.
I created a schedule for manageable subtasks on the meeting and stuck to it most of the time.
I had estimated 2 hours for finishing the design, we finished in 2.5 hours.

# Reflection on team roles
Today's focus was on scheduling, so we didn't use team roles in any way. There were parts that we did together, then for some smaller tasks we created a pool of todo items and everybody picked their tasks and worked individually.

I think it was productive.
